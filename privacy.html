  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Effective date: October 16, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Thanks for using CarCulator! We care about your privacy and want to explain what information we do — and don't — collect.</p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <p>Right now, we don't collect or store any personal data. When you use the app to compare loans or leases, all the numbers you enter stay on your device. Nothing gets sent to us or any server.</p>

  <h2>Analytics</h2>
  <p>We may use anonymous app statistics (like crash reports or usage counts) to improve CarCulator. These never include personal details or anything that identifies you.</p>

  <h2>Third-party data</h2>
  <p>If we later add features that use external data (for example, VIN decoders or market price APIs), we'll update this policy to explain what those services might use.</p>

  <h2>Data security & deletion</h2>
  <p>Because we don't collect or store anything, your data stays with you. Deleting the app removes your information from your device.</p>

  <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>CarCulator isn't designed for kids under 13, and we don't collect information from them.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>If we update this policy, we'll post the new version here with a new date.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
