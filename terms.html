  <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
  <p><em>Effective date: October 16, 2025</em></p>

  <p>By using CarCulator (the "App"), you agree to these terms.</p>

  <h2>What CarCulator does</h2>
  <p>CarCulator helps you estimate and compare the costs of buying or leasing a car. It's for information and education only — not financial advice.</p>

  <h2>Accuracy</h2>
  <p>Results are estimates. Actual rates, prices, taxes, and fees vary by lender, dealer, and vehicle. Always verify details before making decisions.</p>

  <h2>Liability</h2>
  <p>We're not responsible for losses or outcomes from using the App. Use at your own discretion.</p>

  <h2>Third-party data</h2>
  <p>If we add features that pull data from external sources (like VIN or pricing APIs), that information is provided "as is," and their terms apply.</p>

  <h2>Ownership</h2>
  <p>All app designs, text, and code are owned by CarCulator. You can't copy, resell, or distribute without permission.</p>

  <h2>Updates</h2>
  <p>We may update the App or these terms. Continued use means you accept the latest version.</p>

  <h2>Governing law</h2>
  <p>These terms are governed by Florida, USA law.</p>
